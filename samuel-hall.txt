on GitHub, you start by git add ., then git commit -m "commit message" and finall git push -u origin branch-name. Finally open GitHub on your browser and submit a pull-request.
When submitting the pull request, make sure that your not submitting a request to commit to the Lambda branch but commit to your forked repo.
